#final year capstone project - SSM Data Processing

This project was undertaken during my final year of B.Tech in Information Technology. 
This was done under supervison of Dr. M. C. Ramadevi of Space Astronomy Group, SSIF
in U.R. Rao Satellite Centre.

This project is to take the readings of the appearance of these transients provided by the Scanning
Sky Monitor SSM module on the Astrosat satellite, store it in a database and link it to the GUI 
(built using Kivy) and build an algorithm that plots a graph on detection of these transients.

The final output of this project (backend notebook) is a graph that shows the detection of the 
transients for a given period of time.
